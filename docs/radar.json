This is in spite of the existing de jure or de facto standards for authoring mathematics, like MathML, LaTeX, or asciimath, which have been around for a very long time and are widely used by the mathematical and technical communities.</p>\n<p>While MathML was supposed to solve the problem of rendering mathematics on the web it lacks in both implementations and general interest from browser vendors. However, in the past decade, many math rendering tools have been pushing math on the web forward using HTML/CSS and SVG.</p>\n<p>One of the identified issues is that, while browser manufacturers have continually improved and extended their HTML and CSS layout engines, the approaches to render mathematics have not been able to align with these improvements. In fact, the current approaches to math layout could be considered to be largely disjoint from the other technologies of OWP. Another key issue, is that exposing (and thus leveraging) semantic information of mathematical and scientific content on the web needs to move towards modern practices and standards instead of being limited to a single solution (MathML). Such information is critical for accessibility, machine-readability, and re-use of mathematical content.</p>\n<p>This Community Group intends to look at the problems of math on the web in a very bottom-up manner. Experts in this group should identify how the core OWP layout engines, centered around HTML, SVG, and CSS, can be re-used for the purpose of mathematical layout by mapping mathematical entities on top of these, thereby ensuring a much more efficient result, and making use of current and future OWP optimization possibilities. Similarly, experts should work to identify best practices for semantics from the point of view of today's successful solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Should it sync things up on its own? Is it enough to expose some info and knobs such as the relationship to the <code>Performance.now</code> clock and the average latency of the processing pipeline, as done in the Web Audio API?</li>\n<li>If processing of the data needs to be done by the app, what does it mean to synchronize the streams? I.e. would triggering an event at the right time be enough when high-precision is required? Or should the app rather have a way to monitor the information one way or the other through a worklet, or a processing mechanism close to the rendering pipeline such as <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is interesting to see the relationship between this need and similar needs expressed over the years by media companies.

For good reasons as transmission can then benefit from insider codec and transport knowledge to prepare optimized packets. However, separating encoder/decoder from transport and exposing an encoder/decoder API may also makes sense in some cases. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it would make it possible to distribute one stream to multiple transports, which can be useful in teleconference systems where a server/computer acts as <a href=\"https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selective Forward Unit</a> (SFU).</li>\n<li>it would give apps more control over the jitter buffer and other performance parameters for cases where latency is critical (e.g. distributed orchestra)</li>\n<li>it would allow apps to add their own encryption scheme before transport</li>\n<li>it would allow apps to bring their own codec for WebRTC as described in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"234132318\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/90\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/w3c/strategy/issues/90/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/90\">#90</a></li>\n<li>it would allow to use the same transport for audio/video/data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some questions that such work would raise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relationship with MSE/EME and the Media recorder API? This seems to bring some redundancy.</li>\n<li>Similarly, for audio, relationship with the Web Audio API?</li>\n<li>Efficiency? As said, there are good reasons to combine encoder/decoder and transport in WebRTC scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WebRTC WG might choose to work on this later on, although note that access to encoders/decoders would enable other non-WebRTC-related media use cases, so if other parties are interested, incubation/standardizion could be done in a different group. F2F outcome does not suggest strong support within the WG for now.</p>",

It was then published a Proposed Rec.</p>\n<p>The original group of people that wrote PNG  still functions to discuss PNG and to consider updates to the specification (via an extension registry not by changes to the main spec). It has occasional bursts of activity. It has it's own, lightweight, process involving a minimum duration of involvement before getting to vote.<br>\nYou can see that not much happens by looking at the revision history section in<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngreg-1.4.6-pdg.html\">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngreg-1.4.6-pdg.html</a><br>\nand<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngext-1.4.0-pdg.html\">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngext-1.4.0-pdg.html</a></p>\n<p>The second edition was done jointly with ISO. It included errata from the first edition, but the majority of the work was to comply with ISO requirements on wording and document structure, and to then ensure the resulting spec was technically identical to the original wording. Having gone through that process, it was a lot of effort for little gain.</p>\n<p>The ISO and W3C versions of PNG second edition are precisely identical, except for the cover pages. The W3C one is free and the ISO one is on paper and costs money. Copyright is joint; W3C copyright on ours, ISO copyright on theirs.</p>\n<p>The APNG proposal was voted on but  rejected (I voted in favour). Since then it had a little implementation (in Mozilla and in the old, Presto-based Opera). In 2016 Apple also added support (at the OS level, for the iOS iMessage app).<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://caniuse.com/#search=apng\">http://caniuse.com/#search=apng</a></p>\n<p>Google was always opposed because they wanted to promote WebP instead, although that continues to be discussed and experimental (non-shipping) support is going in as of July 2016:<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1171\">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1171</a><br>\nand now seesm to be ready to ship<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/KcMjmFOgG2w\">https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/KcMjmFOgG2w</a></p>\n<p>Microsoft was neither for or against.

However, from a W3C perspective, that was only worth doing if at least one of Google or Microsoft planned to ship APNG support in their browser. Getting support into the main libpng software library would also be a benefit.</p>\n<p>That work would also roll in the extensions:<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngreg-1.4.6-pdg.html\">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngreg-1.4.6-pdg.html</a><br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngext-1.4.0-pdg.html\">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/register/pngext-1.4.0-pdg.html</a></p>",

    "body": "<p><em>This is a stub to be expanded</em></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>There is increasing use of AI for a wide range of applications based upon deep learning with multi-layer neural networks for classification and control. These have drawbacks in requiring very large amounts of training data, and suffering from a lack transparency. This becomes an issue when AI is used for making decisions that effect people. If the decision is challenged people will demand but not receive an explanation as to why their loan request was reused, or why their insurance premium is so high.</p>\n<p>Symbolic representations by contrast enable explanations based upon named relationships and inferences across them. For this reason it is interesting to explore the means to combine symbolic representations with the numerical weights featured in neural networks. The Cognitive Web is an extension of the Semantic Web that combines the Semantic Web with concepts and techniques from Cognitive Science. In particular, associating weights and time stamps with triples and nodes in RDF Graphs as a basis for cognitively plausible models of memory retrieval and rule activation, and based upon work on <a href=\"http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/peoplepages/ja/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John R. Anderson</a> on <a href=\"http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ACT-R</a>.</p>\n<p>This is relevant to W3C as an evolution of the Semantic Web and Linked Data to support cognitively plausible mechanisms of recall and reasoning as a basis for future services.</p>\n<h2>Architecture</h2>\n<p>The following is adopted from ACT-R by expanding ACT-R's chunks to RDF's triples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cognitive Graph with a set of triples</li>\n<li>Conditon-Action rules</li>\n<li>Input and Output buffers</li>\n<li>Goal stacks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The weights and timestamps are updated to reflect a mathematical model of utility. This applies to both graphs and the rules that operate on them. The rule language would be based upon the shape rule language (SHRL).</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>An initial investigation in the form of a proof of concept implementation and application to selected use cases. This would be followed by the launch of a W3C incubation group to take the work further.</p>",

Ontology languages like OWL focus on inferencing and not on validation. There is however an increasing need to be able to validate RDF graphs against a set of rules, and a need for rules that transform RDF graphs. One use case is to validate descriptions of things in the Web of things, and to verify that a thing that claims to support a given semantic model actually satisfies the constraints defined by that model. Another is to transform a description of a class of things into a specific thing.</p>\n<p>A further criteria is that the rule language should be easy to understand by non-specialists, and lend itself to editing tools, e.g. graphical user interfaces.  One promising direction is based upon augmented transition networks (ATNs) which were developed in the late 60's and early 70's for natural language parsing and has a natural representation as diagrams.</p>",

    "body": "<p>The Web Payments Working Group is focusing on the payment transaction. There is an opportunity for future work on the commercial transaction of which the payment is just a part. When you use a credit card in a brick and mortar store, you are given the credit card transaction receipt and a receipt that lists what you purchased along with the associated terms and conditions. This is what you need to keep if you want to return the goods. There is an opportunity for work on standards for digital receipts that can be issued electronically at the time of purchase. One use case is when are checking out at a store and you are required to provide a receipt to prove that you purchased an item, that you are carrying, in another store. Another use case is to enable third party applications to have access to the digital receipts for your purchases, e.g. to provide categorised summaries on a monthly basis. One idea is to use annotated HTML to enable machine interpretation whilst giving the issuer control over the branding and look of the receipt.</p>\n<p>This is related to other opportunities on loyalty schemes, discount coupons, and prepaid vouchers, tickets for events (e.g. concerts) and even for metropolitan transportation.  A common thread is the idea of a digital wallet with open standards for data formats and APIs.  This work could be picked up by the Web Payments Interest Group, but a good first step could be a W3C workshop  to bring together a broad range of stakeholders to discuss the opportunities and see if there is sufficient interest to take these ideas further.</p>",

If a picture is worth a thousand words, that's 180,000 words per sticker.</p>\n<h3>Open Platform</h3>\n<p>Naturally, animated stickers are a free platform.

Keyboards, pointing devices (mice, touchscreens, etc.), and gamepads are all typically implemented using the HID protocol. However, this support relies on the operating system's HID drivers that transform the HID input into native input APIs. Devices that are not well supported by the HID driver are often inaccessible to web pages. Similarly, the outputs on most devices are also inaccessible.</p>\n<p>The inability to access uncommon or unusual HID devices is particularly painful when it comes to gamepad support. Gamepads designed for PC often use HID for gamepad inputs (buttons, joysticks, triggers) and outputs (LEDs, rumble). However, gamepads inputs and outputs are not well standardized and web browsers often require custom logic for specific devices. This is unsustainable and results in poor support for the long tail of older and uncommon devices. It also causes the browser to depend on quirks present in the behavior of specific devices.</p>\n<p>A HID standard for the web platform would allow the device-specific logic to be moved into javascript for devices that lack support in the browser.</p>\n</blockquote>",

    "body": "<p>Web browsers can be used to provide user interfaces for services for the Web of Things. This can be implemented using JavaScript and the browser supported protocols (HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC). There is a further opportunity for using Web browsers for installing apps onto your smart home hub when visiting a vendor's website. This raises challenges around how the browser identifies the home hub, and gets the user's permission for installing the app, along with the associated security and privacy concerns. I am expecting home hubs that support apps written in JavaScript, and this raises opportunities for re-use of browser APIs on home hubs.  This will require incubation, but a first step could be a workshop that looks at web of things related work across different groups as well as the expected need for new standards. A workshop would bring together people from different communities and help prepare the ground for further collaboration.</p>",
